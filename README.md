# React + Vite
This project is about redux, a single storage for application state.

The project emphasis more on state,actions and reducers which is fundamental services provided by redux.

The aim of redux is  to isolate state handling from React component responsible for rendering views.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
